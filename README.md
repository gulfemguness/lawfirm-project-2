# Connor was assigned formatting the layout of login + logo header + nav + footer and uploaded template.html + main.css
# Gulfem and Diana was assigned 2 pages to fill in the middle content

## To-do  (Gulfem)
# fix the alignment issues on the contact page, font & image size
# add text color to the upper paragraph and title in the right column
# make it responsive (columns get unshaped when the page size gets smaller)

## While trying to add an active link color to the Contact Us on the nav, I messed up with Connor's all nav link colors (turned blue from black). SORRY, I will fix it.
